I developed and deployed a Breast Cancer Classification web app using PyTorch and Streamlit. 
The model predicts whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on diagnostic features.
I implemented data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization; all integrated into 
an interactive interface.
